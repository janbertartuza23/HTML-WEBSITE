				<h2 class="font3">Akita</h2>
				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Akita is a strong, courageous, and family-oriented dog. They have strong guarding instincts and are protective and territorial. They are quiet, large and powerful dogs who can be intimidating. Temperaments range within the breed. Some are calm, and some are aggressive, so the breed should always be supervised around children. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not usually aggressive toward people, but they are wary of strangers. They are food aggressive, so they need to have their own food dish and a safe space to eat. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care needs to be taken to keep children away from the food while the dog is eating. The Akita is typically gentle with and protective of children, but isn't always tolerant of the erratic behavior of small children, and no child wants to be snapped at by a giantÂ Akita. They can also be intolerant of other dogs and are often aggressive towards other animals. They have a natural hunting instinct and should never be allowed to roam outside of a safely fenced-in area. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Akita is bright and sensitive, but he is also independent, headstrong, and dominant, so it is important to start obedience training early. If you do not assume the role of pack leader, he will.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with patience and perseverance, the Akita is highly trainable because of their intelligence. They are rather famous for being easy to housetrain. The Akita has moderate exercise needs and should get exercise daily. They are sensitive and responsive and will thrive on your attention. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Akita will probably decide his purpose in life is to protect you and spend time with you. The Akita will only bark for a good reason, but they do "talk" a lot. They grunt and groan and mumble tocommunicate, which is endearing for the Akita lovers of the world. They also like to carry things in their mouths, and this includes your wrist. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might take hold of your arm and gently lead you to the food bin. While it takes the right person and family to raise an Akita, the rewards are rich. Your Akita will be a part of the family, a loyal protector with unparalleled devotion.
