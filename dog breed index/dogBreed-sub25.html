					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bernese MountainDog was bred to be the farmer's companion, and today, a Bernese Mountain Dog will want to be by your side at all times. They make a great family dog, and usually single out one person in the household to be their best friend. They are loyal and devoted and will strive to please you. They are excellent with kind and gentle children. They are extremely intelligent, and are known for manipulating their humans. Because of their intelligence, they need to be mentally stimulated. They are gentle, easygoing, good-natured, affectionate, and docile
					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. They are incredibly devoted to their own family, and generally aloof towards strangers. A tendency to be shy runs in the breed, and early socialization is important. Most Bernese Mountain Dogs do well with other animals, but some of them do chase smaller animals.

					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. They need daily exercise, but not as much as some more energetic breeds. They don't enjoy playing fetch and certainly don't make good jogging partners. In warm weather, they will dig holes to try to get at the cool earth, and this will often happen in your favorite flower bed. In general, they love to be outside, as long as you are there with them.
                     <br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always want to be part of the family and will demand a lot of your attention. Inside, they are usually quiet and calm, though their wagging tail will often find your cup of coffee. They do not bark unnecessarily, but will announce a stranger at the door, so they make good watchdogs. They are very protective of the members of their family. 

					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are slow to mature, and can act "puppyish" for several years. The younger Bernese Mountain Dogs are very active, and the older ones are pleasantly mellow, though they still take a lively interest in family business. In short, this is a devoted breed who will need to be right in the thick of things.
