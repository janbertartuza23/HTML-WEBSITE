				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bedlington Terrier is an adaptable, versatile, affectionate, and entertaining dog. He isdetermined, inquisitive, opinionated, feisty, and fearless. He has a big heart and will become your shadow following you around everywhere you go. He loves to play, retrieve, jog, and curlup with you when you curl up with a good book. He enjoys just hanging out with you. He is a clownish extrovert and likes to be the center of attention. He will leap for joy when visitors come to your house.
					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. He is an energetic, yet gentle, playmate for children. He loves all people, but he especially loves children (though no Terrier will put up with being teased by one). He is usually very quiet unless something gets his goat and then the terrier in him takes over. While he can be a bit headstrong, he is also eager to please. But he is only moderately easy to train.
