				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predominantly bred as a working gun dog, theChesapeake Bay Retriever is truly an all-around dog who loves to be at the center of an active family. Their dominant and protective nature can be a blessing to some, but it can be a hazard to a family that is ill prepared. Chessies need consistent obedience training. They need a master who can act like the pack leader, or a Chesapeake will challenge him or her on everything. The Chesapeake is a big dog and you do not want him thinking he is in charge. Chessies bark. They are good at it. They also growl, grumble, and say "roo" in a loud voice over and over again. They were bred to bark in order to protect their master's property, so it unreasonable to think you can train the bark out of him.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. If you don't appreciate a talentedbarker in your house, there are many quieter breeds out there. Chesapeakes make great watchdogs as they are naturally protective, but they need to be socialized early on so that they don't develop aggression. They are athletic, agile and fast! They need daily exercise and love to play outdoors, especially in the water. Water retrievals are a favorite pastime! They also need mental stimulation. A bored Chessy is bad news. They are tolerant of other dogs, but usually uninterested in them. (They can also be uninterested in strangers.) They seem to have a special affinity for children. A well-trained Chesapeake who knows what is expected of him will be a happy, exceptionally devoted, incredibly loving family pet. They love to spend time with their people, and will want to be your best friend. They are sensitive, intensely loyal, and will want to please you.
