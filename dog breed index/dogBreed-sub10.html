				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Staffordshire Terrier is a people-oriented dogwho thrives when he is part of a family. They are intelligent, graceful, loyal, feisty, courageous, and very, very strong. Amstaffs are an active breed, always ready for fun, and they love to play outdoors. They are high energy and need regular exercise. 
					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. They can be rowdy and overly exuberant, especially when they are young. They do best when they have a job to do. A bored Amstaff will destroy your house. They do well in obedience, agility, tracking, and conformation. Obedience training is very important with this breed.
					<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They really need an interactive owner who will spend time with them, training them and playing with them and just being their best friend. But they also need an owner who is able to establish leadership, as Amstaffs definitely have a mind of their own.
                     <br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amstaffs are protective and they look imposing so they can make an effective deterrent, but they are really too friendly to be guard dogs. Some Amstaffs are dog aggressive and none will back down if challenged. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amstaffs love their children and are patient, gentle, and tolerant. Of course, very young children should always be supervised around any dog. This is an animal who will strive to please you and take great pride in making you laugh. He will demand a lot of your attention and will be an excellent companion, for you and your family.
