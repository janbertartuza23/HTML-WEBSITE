				<p class = "font2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afghan Hound is a dignified sight hound with an independent spirit. The personalities within the breed differ drastically, but all Afghans are loyal, loving companions when placed with an active, loving family! Afghan Hounds need regular exercise.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They like to run, so will do best with a fenced yard, but be aware that some Afghans have been able to jump over fences. If Afghans do not get enough exercise, they can become destructive. And Afghans are smart enough to open dresser drawers in order to get at something you really don't want them to chew. Afghans have a sense of humor and require the same of you. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are happy dogs who are independent thinkers and can be difficult to train. Sometimes they are so intelligent that their intelligence can make training more difficult. They can be difficult to housetrain, and are notorious for not performing well on the recall. They are also notorious for running away.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghans have a strong prey instinct and will chase anything that moves. This includes small animals inside your home. Many Afghans have successfully lived with cats, but this does not mean that they are trustworthy around all cats. The Afghan is calm and patient and he does well with well-behaved children. They are usually wary around strangers. These are loving dogs who are not overly demonstrative.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some dig. Some climb. Some will try to commandeer your furniture. Most of them will feel entitled to sleep in your bed. These are sensitive creatures, and are particularly sensitive to stress. Maybe this is why they make such good therapy dogs.
