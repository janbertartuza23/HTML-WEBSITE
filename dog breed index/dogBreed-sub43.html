					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardigan WelshCorgi equals big personality in a littledog. These are intelligent, active, alert little guys who will want to be the center of your world. They love to be with their families, and will shower you with loyalty, devotion and affection. They need daily exercise and love to take long walks with you. They are intelligent and eagerto please and do great with obedience training. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They excel in obedience, agility, flyball, Frisbee, herding, and tracking competitions. They get along very well with respectful children, but parents need to be aware that Corgis might try to herd kids. (They also might try to herd other animals and your houseguests.) Most Corgis like to be with other cats and dogs. They are adaptable dogs and can live anywhere as long as they get walked, but they do like to bark, so close neighbors might object. While personalities differ within the breed, in general, theCorgi is even-tempered, hardy, friendly, loyal and loving. And they are always full of fun.
