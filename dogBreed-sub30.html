					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Border Collies, known as the workaholics of the dog world, are a lot of work. They need a job to do, whether its herding, agility, flyball, Frisbee championships ... anything to keep their overactive brains busy! If you don't give a Border Collie the physical and mental exercise he needs, he will destroy everything. And I'm not just talking about socks and teddy bears. I'm talking: mattresses, recliners, carpets, and wooden stairs! They can also seriously harm themselves by ingesting foreign objects. Some have even eaten nails and knives! And a Border Collie can total the interior of a car. These athletic, working dogs are extremely athletic and need hours of exercise each day! They need to run, and they need a purpose.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Border Collies do best in a fenced-in yard. But be aware that Border Collies are extremely athletic and can jump over a six foot fence if they decide it's worth the trouble. Border Collies will not necessarily do well with other animals in the house either, because ... you guessed it -- they will try to herd them. It is impossible to train the herding out of a Border Collie. These dogs are highly intelligent and will try to over-think everything. They've been called the most intelligent breed in the world. So prospective owners should ask themselves, "Do I want a dog who's smarter than me?" But for the right person, the devoted, passionate Border Collie parent, the breed makes an affectionate and extraordinarily devoted pet. They are sweet and sensitive. They are even known for reading their owner's minds (which could
